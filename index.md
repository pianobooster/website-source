## **Boost** your **Piano** playing skills

<p class="greyed">
**PianoBooster** is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and
at the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation.
The difference between playing along to a CD or a standard MIDI file
is that **PianoBooster** listens and follows what you are playing on a MIDI piano keyboard.

## NEWS -- Version 1.0.0 is released.
</div>

**Welcome to the brand new Piano Booster website.**

A new version of Piano Boster is now
[available with exectuables](download.html) for Windows, macOS and Linux (AppImage).
Also please see the [user forum](http://piano-booster.2625608.n2.nabble.com/Piano-Booster-Users-f1591936.html) for more details of this news.

## Introduction

**PianoBooster** is a free (Open Source) program that plays Standard Midi Files
and allows you to change the speed of playback
and transpose the music etc.
There is a scrolling musical stave that shows the notes for just one part
from all the parts in the complete musical arrangement.

**PianoBooster** has been designed to allow you to play along on a MIDI piano keyboard
with the scrolling notes shown on the screen.
The notes you press on the keyboard appear as coloured
lines on the musical stave, the colour of which depends whether
you have pressed the right or wrong note.


A different musical instrument sound is used
for your playing depending whether you are playing the right or wrong notes.
This feature  also allows Piano Booster to be used with printed sheet music
so you can hear if you are playing the right notes while at the same time
keeping your eyes on the printed score.
The music accompaniment will automatically wait for you to find and
play the correct notes in the piece.
